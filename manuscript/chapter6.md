# DevOps Doesn't Exclude Anyone
Because... well, because it's _called_ Dev Ops, there's often this feeling that the philosophy excludes security... or network infrastructure... or graphics designers... or someone.

It doesn't.

If DevOps _means_ any one thing, it means _everyone collaborating._ But what it doesn't mean is someone having a veto. For example, IT Security can't swoop in and say, "there's no way we can automate the deployment of that app _Because Security_." That's not collaboration; It's obstructionism. What they _can_ say is, "in order to automate the deployment of that particular app, we need to make sure _x_ and _y_ are happening." Security, Development, and Operations can work together to _automate_ those requirements, helping ensure they're carried out consistently every single time. Security _wins_ because their concerns are addressed automatically, _as a part of the process_. Development wins because they get better insight into Security concerns. Operations wins because they get to stop being the middleman who has to reconcile everyone's crap.

But this is why DevOps *cannot* work without management buy-in from a very high level, i.e. the CEO and CIO (or CTO). The bits of your company that have traditionally worked in their own little fiefdoms need to give up their royal styles and work _together_. "No" is never the answer; It's "here's how." That, as I'm sure you can imagine, can be a massive political difficulty in some organizations. And _that_ is where people fail at DevOps.
